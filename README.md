## Features :mount_fuji:

 - [x] Part of speech tagging
 - [x] Lemmatization
 - [x] Dependency parsing
 - [x] Morphological analysis
 - [ ] Named entity recognition (work in progress :construction:)

## Installation :sunrise:

OdyCy models can be directly installed from huggingface:

```bash
# TODO: We have to add a proper download link
```

## Usage :whale:

OdyCy pipelines can be imported with spaCy.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("grc_dep_treebanks_trf")  # TODO: Rename model here
```

Pipelines can then be used as any other spaCy pipeline.
([spaCy Documentation](https://spacy.io/usage))

Check out our Documentation on [Basic Usage](https://centre-for-humanities-computing.github.io/odyCy/getting_started.html).

## Performance :boat:

odyCy achieves state of the art performance on multiple tasks on unseen test data from the Universal Dependencies Perseus treebank,
and performs second best on the PROIEL treebankâ€™s test set on even more tasks.
In addition performance also seems relatively stable across the two evaluation datasets in comparison with other NLP pipelines.
